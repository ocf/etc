    <p>
      The OCF is closed Monday, October 28 all day due to campus closure for the PG&amp;E Public Safety Power Shutoff. We will remain closed throughout the outage.
      <br /><br />
      At this point, most other OCF services are expected to remain available throughout the outage, including webhosting and mail. Please refer to our <a href="https://status.ocf.berkeley.edu">status blog</a> for more information during the outage. We will be providing info on that site as we receive it.
