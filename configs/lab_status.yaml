    <p>
        On Friday 10/11 afternoon, power was restored to MLK Student Union building. However, OCF will remain closed for the remainder of the day. We will resume our normal hours starting Saturday, 10/12.
        <br /><br />
        At this point, all services should be restored. If you are experiencing problems, please <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/contact/">contact us</a>. Also, if you sent us any email during the outage, you may want to resend it, as our email servers were offline.
