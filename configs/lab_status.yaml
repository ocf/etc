    <h4 id="banner-header">MLK Building Closure/Power Outage, Wednesday 10/09</h4>
    <p>
        On Wednesday 10/09, MLK Student Union building will be closed in anticipation of PG&E Public Safety Power Shutdown. Therefore, OCF <b>will be closed</b> that day. We do not yet know whether we will be open on Thursday 10/10.
        <br /><br />
        Because of the power outage, all OCF services will be unavailable, including this website. Status updates will be posted to our blog (<a href="https://status.ocf.berkeley.edu">status.ocf.berkeley.edu</a>) as necessary.
